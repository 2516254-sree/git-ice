    <h1>FRONT END TOOLS</h1>
   <ul>
<P>
In web development, tools are categorised into the front end (what users see and interact with) and the back end (the server-side logic and data management). Some tools, like Visual Studio Code and JavaScript, are versatile enough to be used across both layers. 
</p>

<p>
Front-End Tools (The "Client-Side")
Front-end development focuses on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
